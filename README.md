# rolling-dice-game

- i made a rolling dice game, using #JS #HTML #CSS
  
- Game rules are:
  - every player that have a total score of 100 is winner
  - every player can roll the dice
      - each roll gives the current player a number that will be added to the last dice number
      - if the dice number at any roll becomes 1,
          - the player's current number will be 0
          - the turn will be passed to the next player
  - every player can hold, this will
      - add the current number to the total amount
      - pass the turn to the next player
